# Facial-Expression CK+48
# Image Classification Project

This repository contains an emotion classification project using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) implemented with Keras. The project aims to classify images into 5 distinct categories with high accuracy.

## Project Overview

The main objective of this project is to develop a deep-learning model capable of accurately classifying human emotions. The model was trained on images from the CK+48 dataset and evaluated to ensure its effectiveness.

### Key Features
- **Training**: The model is trained to identify and classify images into predefined categories.
- **Evaluation**: The model's performance is assessed on a test dataset.
- **Logging**: Training progress is logged, and the best-performing model is saved for future use.
- **Timing**: Custom callbacks are used to measure and log the time taken for training and testing.

### Results
- **Test Accuracy**: 97.35%
- **Test Loss**: 0.2545
- **Testing Time**: 0.042 seconds

## Usage
